            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <div class="para"><p>I am Shagun Verma, a student with a deep inclination towards the art of writing. For me, writing is not merely a pastime but a way to translate emotions, observations, and ideas into meaningful expression. Poetry enables me to capture delicate moments and abstract feelings, while essays allow me to reason, reflect, and engage with the world more thoughtfully. <br>

This portfolio presents a selection of my poems and essays that illustrate my growth as a young writer. Each piece reflects a blend of imagination, inspiration, and introspection, making this collection a mirror of both my thoughts and my journey. Through my words, I aspire not only to express myself but also to inspire readers to see the beauty and depth that language can hold.</p> </div>
