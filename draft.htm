        <!-- <div class="para"><p>I am Shagun Verma, a student with a deep inclination towards the art of writing. For me, writing is not merely a pastime but a way to translate emotions, observations, and ideas into meaningful expression. Poetry enables me to capture delicate moments and abstract feelings, while essays allow me to reason, reflect, and engage with the world more thoughtfully. <br>

This portfolio presents a selection of my poems and essays that illustrate my growth as a young writer. Each piece reflects a blend of imagination, inspiration, and introspection, making this collection a mirror of both my thoughts and my journey. Through my words, I aspire not only to express myself but also to inspire readers to see the beauty and depth that language can hold.</p> </div>  -->

                        <h1>Responsibility: The succes Mantra</h1> <br>

                   
                    <p>
                      Being responsible, the success mantra, <br>
Cannot be denied by anyone. <br>
It's the path to destiny, <br>
Adhering to it is essential. <br> 
<div class="gap"></div>
Responsibility lights the way, <br>
Guiding the mind both night and day. <br>
Truly, taking responsibility is taking duty, <br>
It's about embracing each opportunity. <br>
<div class="gap"></div>
Every day brings new responsibility, <br>
New opportunities, new chances, new challenges. <br>
Like a lantern glowing in the dark, <br>
It shows the way and ignites the spark. <br>
With every step, we learn and grow, <br>
And let the light within us show. <br>
<div class="gap"></div>
This is the light that guides us from birth onwards, <br>
It teaches us to stand up tall, <br>
To rise again when we should fall. <br>
To keep the faith when times are tough, <br>
And know that strength is more than enough. <br>
<div class="gap"></div>

    So take each duty with a proud embrace, <br>
    And meet each challenge face to face. <br>
    For when you own your path and choice, <br>
    Your heart will find its truest voice. <br>
    <div class="gap"></div>
    And when the journey feels too long, <br>
    Responsibility will make you strong. <br>
    With courage as your trusted friend, <br>
    You'll walk with purpose to the end. <br>
    <div class="gap"></div>

                    </p>
                     </div>
