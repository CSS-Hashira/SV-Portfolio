                    <p>
                        Even in the darkness, it doesn’t fall, <br>
Dream, imagine, rise and soar tall. <br>
Be the personality that shines so true, <br>
One day the world will bow to you. <br>

 
Fly between the horizon of the sky, <br>
Touch it and aim even more high. <br>
Dive into the sea of hard work deep, <br>
Harvest the dreams that you dare to keep. <br>


Never feel feared, be bold, persevere, <br>
You’ll have to cross each hurdle and tier. <br>
You are the best human source, <br>
Unleash your potential, your unstoppable force. <br>


Each step forward, a victory won, <br>
Each rising dawn says, “You’ve just begun.” <br>
First be the star that shines in yourself, <br>
Glow only when it’s too dark for help. <br>

                     Being responsible, the success mantra, <br>
Cannot be denied by anyone. <br>
It's the path to destiny, <br>
Adhering to it is essential. <br>
<div class="gap"></div>
Responsibility lights the way, <br>
Guiding the mind both night and day. <br>
Truly, taking responsibility is taking duty, <br>
It's about embracing each opportunity. <br>
<div class="gap"></div>
Every day brings new responsibility, <br>
New opportunities, new chances, new challenges. <br>
Like a lantern glowing in the dark, <br>
It shows the way and ignites the spark. <br>
With every step, we learn and grow, <br>
And let the light within us show. <br>
      </div>


      <div class="column">
        This is the light that guides us from birth onwards, <br>
It teaches us to stand up tall, <br>
To rise again when we should fall. <br>
To keep the faith when times are tough, <br>
And know that strength is more than enough. <br>

<div class="gap"></div>
    So take each duty with a proud embrace, <br>
    And meet each challenge face to face. <br>
    For when you own your path and choice, <br>
    Your heart will find its truest voice. <br>
    <div class="gap"></div>
    And when the journey feels too long, <br>
    Responsibility will make you strong. <br>
    With courage as your trusted friend, <br>
    You'll walk with purpose to the end. <br>
